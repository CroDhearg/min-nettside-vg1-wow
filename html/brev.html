                <h1>Dear Andreas Bjelland Eriksen,</h1>
                <p>
                    I hope this letter finds you well. My name is, and I am writing to you because I care deeply about the future of our planet and Norway's role in protecting it. I believe that Norway can be a global leader in fighting climate change, and one area in which we can do better is how we deal with food waste and recycling.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Tons of food are thrown away yearly in Norway; most of this may be composted or otherwise treated to biogas instead of incineration and landfills. Improved recycling of food waste is potentially able to reduce GHG emissions, at the same time offering a higher value on other resources. Support for new biogas plants could power buses or trucks and even homes in a sustainable manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also believe that the people need further education on the subject of food waste. Very few people know how much energy and water are lost when food is thrown away. Campaigns via schools and local communities could make all the difference.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As a leader, you have the power to make these changes take place. I hope you will push to make stronger policies and programs that help Norway become even greener.

Thank you for devoting your time and for listening.

Sincerely,
Lucas
